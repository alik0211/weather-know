## Workflow

- In the names of branches use the template `issue-[number]`. For example, if you are doing issue 12, the branch should be called `issue-12`.
- The PR description must contain the text `Resolve #[issue number]`. For example, if your PR solves problem 12, then the description should be `Resolve #12`. This is necessary so that when merging, the issue is closed automatically
